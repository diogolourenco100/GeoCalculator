# GeoCalc - Geolocation Calculator
## 1 - Install the requirements
#### *(Install the Geopy, Geocoder, Pyfiglet and Colorama libraries)*
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## 2 - Execute the Script
## *Linux*
```bash
python3 geocalc.py
```
## *Windows*
```bash
python.exe geocalc.py
```
##### or
```bash
py geocalc.py
```

## How to use

#### - After running the script, it will ask for two locations: the *source* location and the *destination.* 

#### - If you want to use your own location, just leave it *empty* and it will collect your IP and get an approximate location.

#### ⚠️ *It is important to note that it will not be 100% accurate, as the script will draw a straight line between the two locations, instead of drawing the distance taking into account streets, reliefs, among other factors.*
